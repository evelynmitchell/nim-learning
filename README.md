Inspired by a couple of projects I read this morning, I decided to try to learn Nim .

Nim is an interesting combination of the simple syntax of Python, the static typing of Rust and the speed of C.

I'm starting by following the tutorial at [learnXinYminutes](https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/nim/). My inital program is xiny.nim
